<p>
    This sample show the basics of logging using the PnP framework. You can use the subscription model to log to one or more logs, as well as set the log level. You will find several log listeners already
    built in, these are: ConsoleListener, FunctionListener, and AzureInsightsListener. The ConsoleListener will log to the browser console. FunctionListener will pass any messages to your custom logic wrapped in 
    the function supplied in the constructor. Finally, AzureInsightsListener allows you to log information to your Azure Insights account - you must pass in your instrumentation key in the constructor.
