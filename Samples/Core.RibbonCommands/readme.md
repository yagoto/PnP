# Overview #
The purpose of this scenario is to demonstrate how to add a ribbon command to the host web. Ribbon commands are housed in a Custom Action, so we leverage the Web.UserCustomActions property to add a new custom action, but we add XML for the CommandUIExtension.

_NOTE: It is easiest to build the CommandUIExtension by creating a SharePoint Elements.xml file and create a CustomAction element with ribbon XML to follow._

## Adding the Ribbon ##
The following describes how the XML is loaded into the CommandUIExtension and a new custom action is created or updated.

_NOTE: During development, it is helpful to continually run this code to ensure that the ribbon looks the way you expect._ 

```C#
// get xml CommandUIExtension node from elements.xml file
... 

// see of the custom action already exists
var customAction = clientContext.Web.UserCustomActions
					.FirstOrDefault(uca => uca.Name == customActionName);

// if it does not exist, create it
if (customAction == null) {
    // create the ribbon
    customAction = clientContext.Web.UserCustomActions.Add();
    customAction.Name = customActionName;
}

// set custom action properties
customAction.Location = location;
customAction.CommandUIExtension = xmlContent; // CommandUIExtension node XML
customAction.RegistrationId = registrationId;
customAction.RegistrationType = registrationType;
customAction.Sequence = sequence;

customAction.Update();
clientContext.Load(customAction);
clientContext.ExecuteQuery();
```
