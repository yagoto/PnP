# Overview #
This sample demonstrates how to add download multiple files functionality to SharePoint document libraries using JavaScript.
Two new buttons are added to the ribbon:

- Download All – initiates separate downloads for selected files (including files in subfolders);
- Download All as Zip – generates ZIP file containing all files and subfolders, and initiates download.

This functionality is built using JavaScript only approach. Obviously, this brings some limitations, as ZIP files are generated in memory on the client machine. However, it allows the customers having no app hosting environment to introduce this functionality. In addition, comparing to provider-hosted model (for example, on Azure), it allows to avoid additional charges for outgoing traffic.

The sample relies on the following 3rd party libraries:

- [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [multi-download](https://github.com/sindresorhus/multi-download)
- [zip.js](http://gildas-lormeau.github.io/zip.js/)

# Running the sample #
The sample is implemented as a console application that automates deployment. The following steps must be completed in order to run the sample:

1. Create new site collection based on standard Team site template.
2. Open Visual Studio project and update values for `siteUrl`, `username` and `password` variables in `Program.cs`.
3. Run the project.
4. Check new ribbon buttons in document libraries.
